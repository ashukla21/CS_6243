The President has delegated to the Secretary of State the authority to control the export and temporary import of defense articles and services. The items designated by the Secretary of State for purposes of export and temporary import control constitute the U.S. Munitions List (USML) specified inpart 121 of this subchapter. Defense articles on the USML specified inpart 121 of this subchapterthat are also subject to permanent import control by the Attorney General on the U.S. Munitions Import List enumerated in27 CFR part 447are subject to temporary import controls administered by the Secretary of State. Designations of defense articles and defense services on the USML inpart 121 of this subchapterare made by the Department of State with the concurrence of the Department of Defense. The scope of the USML shall be changed only by amendments made pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778).

Pursuant to delegated authorities, the Secretary of State is authorized to make decisions on whether license applications or other written requests for approval shall be granted, or whether exemptions may be used. The Secretary of State is also authorized to revoke, suspend, or amend licenses or other written approvals whenever such action is deemed to be advisable. The administration of the AECA is a foreign affairs function encompassed within the meaning of the military and foreign affairs exclusion of the Administrative Procedure Act and is thereby expressly exempt from various provisions of that Act. Because the exercising of the foreign affairs function, including the decisions required to implement the AECA, is highly discretionary, it is excluded from review under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n## \u00a7 120.21 Disclosure of information.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.22 Advisory opinions and related authorizations.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.23 Organizations and arrangements.\n\n\n## \u00a7\u00a7 120.24-120.29 [Reserved]\n\n\n## Subpart C\u2014Definitions\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.30 Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.\nDirectorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State, Washington, DC 20522-0112.\n\n## \u00a7 120.31 Defense article.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.32 Defense service.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.33 Technical data.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.34 Public domain.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.35 [Reserved]\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.36 Significant military equipment.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.37 Major defense equipment.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.38 Classified.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.39 Foreign defense article or defense service.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.40 Compositional terms.\n[87 FR 16411, Mar. 23, 2022, as amended at88 FR 12213, Feb. 27, 2023]\n\n## \u00a7 120.41 Specially designed.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.42 Form, fit, function, performance capability, equivalent, enumerated, and catch-all control.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.43 Development, production, and related terms; Basic and applied research.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.44 [Reserved]\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.45 Maintenance levels.\n\n\n## \u00a7\u00a7 120.46-120.49 [Reserved]\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.50 Export.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.51 Reexport.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.52 Retransfer.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.53 Temporary import.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.54 Activities that are not exports, reexports, retransfers, or temporary imports.\n\n\n## Cross Reference\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.55 Access information.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.56 Release.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.57 Authorization types.\n\n\n## \u00a7 120.58 Subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).\nItemssubject to the EARare those items listed on the Commerce Control List in part 774 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and all other items that meet the definition of that term in accordance with \u00a7 734.3 of the EAR.
