As described in supplement no. 1 to part 766, voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor, and a firm's deliberate decision not to disclose significant apparent violations is an aggravating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by OEE. A deliberate decision not to disclose occurs when a firm uncovers a significant apparent violation that it has committed but then chooses not to file a VSD."
