Such license requirements are based on the Reasons for Control listed in the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) that applies to the item. Some ECCNs, however, impose license requirements either without reference to a reason for control code that is listed on the Commerce Country Chart, or in addition to such a reference. Those ECCNs may state their license requirements in full in their \u201cReasons for Control\u201d sections or they may refer the reader to another provision of the EAR for license requirement information. In addition, some ECCNs do not impose license requirements, but refer the reader to the regulations of another government agency that may impose license requirements on the items described in that ECCN."
