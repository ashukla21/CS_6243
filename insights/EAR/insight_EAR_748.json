BIS will issue you a determination that each item identified in your classification request is either described by an ECCN in the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR or not described by an ECCN and, therefore, an \u201cEAR99\u201d item. These classification determinations issued by BIS are not U.S. Government determinations that the items described therein are \u201csubject to the EAR,\u201d as this term is defined in \u00a7 734.3 of the EAR. Those who request commodity classifications and advisory opinions should have determined that the items at issue are not subject to the exclusive export control jurisdiction of one of the other U.S. Government agencies listed in \u00a7 734.3(b) of the EAR. If requested, for a given end-use, end-user, and/or destination, BIS will advise you whether a license is required, or likely to be granted, for a particular transaction. Note that these responses do not bind BIS to issuing a license in the future. This type of request, along with requests for guidance regarding other interpretations of the EAR, is commonly referred to as an \u201cAdvisory Opinion.\u201d The encryption provisions in the EAR require the submission of a classification request in accordance with \u00a7 740.17(d) of the EAR in order for certain items to be eligible for export and reexport under License Exception ENC (see \u00a7 740.17 of the EAR) or to be released from \u201cEI\u201d controls (see \u00a7\u00a7 740.17(b)(2) and 740.17(b)(3) of the EAR)."
