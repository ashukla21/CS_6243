This part describes the procedures for imposing administrative sanctions for violations of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (the EAA), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. Parts 760 and 764 of the EAR specify those actions that constitute violations, and part 764 describes the sanctions that apply. In addition to describing the procedures for imposing sanctions, this part describes the procedures for imposing temporary denial orders to prevent imminent violations of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. This part also describes the procedures for taking the discretionary protective administrative action of denying the export privileges of persons who have been convicted of violating any of the statutes, including the EAA, listed in section 11(h) of the EAA. Nothing in this part shall be construed as applying to or limiting other administrative or enforcement action relating to the EAA or the EAR, including the exercise of any investigative authorities conferred by the EAA. This part does not confer any procedural rights or impose any requirements based on the Administrative Procedure Act for proceedings charging violations under the EAA, except as expressly provided for in this part."

Supplements nos. 1 and 2 to this part describe how BIS typically exercises its discretion regarding the issuance of charging letters. The charging letter shall constitute the formal complaint and will state that there is reason to believe that a violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, has occurred. It will set forth the essential facts about the alleged violation, refer to the specific regulatory or other provisions involved, and give notice of the sanctions available under part 764 of the EAR. The charging letter will inform the respondent that failure to answer the charges as provided in\u00a7 766.6 of this partwill be treated as a default under\u00a7 766.7 of this part, that the respondent is entitled to a hearing if a written demand for one is requested with the answer, and that the respondent may be represented by counsel, or by other authorized representative who has a power of attorney to represent the respondent. A copy of the charging letter shall be filed with the administrative law judge, which filing shall toll the running of the applicable statute of limitations. Charging letters may be amended or supplemented at any time before an answer is filed, or, with permission of the administrative law judge, afterwards. BIS may unilaterally withdraw charging letters at any time, by notifying the respondent and the administrative law judge."

Where the administrative law judge determines that documents containing the sensitive matter need to be made available to a respondent to avoid prejudice, the judge may direct BIS to prepare an unclassified and nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents.
